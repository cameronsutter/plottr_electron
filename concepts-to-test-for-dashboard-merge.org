** DONE Third window not opening!?
   I opened a file and then another with the dashboards open and it
   didn't open the third??

   False alarm!  It actually tries to focus a file when it's already
   open and that's what went wrong.
** DONE It seems that adding a new file to the list of known files doesn't work
   Needs binary installation...

   Remove a file from the list of known files and then open it in a
   window.  It should appear on the dashboards of all windows, but it
   doesn't.
** DONE It seems that changing language from the menu does nothing?
   It still seems to work from the dashboard options...
** DONE Open dashboard from menu doesn't seem to work anymore
** DONE Ad view countdown re-renders the progress bar each time it updates :/
** DONE Opening a second file resets the darkMode setting of existing windows(!)

** TODO Update notification styles are broken
** TODO Overflow style of dashboard is broken
   Add many files.  You can't open the bottom ones.
** TODO Opening a link from beamer no longer works
** TODO Beamer bell looks out of place on new dashboard
** DONE If You try to open plottr and the most recent file was deleted then it bombs out...
** DONE After moving file management to main saving temp files doesn't remove the old file anymore
** TODO Open a file after just saving as temp and it'll open it in a new window :'(
** TODO The first time that I tried to save a new file it didn't prompt me
   It thought that it wasn't a temp file :/

   UPDATE: I can't replicate this anymore.

   UPDATE: after *removing logging* from the function that decides
   whether the file is temp and then saves in the files menu, I could
   replicate the problem again(!)
** DONE Known file store not updated across instances anymore
** DONE It doesn't seem to backup anymore
   False alarm! :)
** DONE All the export options are available without a license
