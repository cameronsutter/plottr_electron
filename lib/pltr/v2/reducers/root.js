/**
 * `dataRepairers` is an object which contains various repairs to be
 * made to the data that's loaded from files.  We have it here because
 * often we make fixes to the application which we can't apply to
 * files in the wild.  The best we can do is make sure that the
 * problems are fixed when we load the file into the application.
 * It's the responsibility of each reducer to use applicable data
 * repairers to fix pieces of data which they apply to.
 *
 * The schema of the object is as follows:
 * {
 *   normalizeRCEContent: RCEContent => RCEContent
 * }
