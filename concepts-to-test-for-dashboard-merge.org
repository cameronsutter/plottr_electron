** DONE Third window not opening!?
   I opened a file and then another with the dashboards open and it
   didn't open the third??

   False alarm!  It actually tries to focus a file when it's already
   open and that's what went wrong.
** TODO It seems that adding a new file to the list of known files doesn't work
   Remove a file from the list of known files and then open it in a
   window.  It should appear on the dashboards of all windows, but it
   doesn't.
** TODO It seems that changing language from the menu does nothing?
   It still seems to work from the dashboard options...
** TODO Open dashboard from menu doesn't seem to work anymore
** DONE Ad view countdown re-renders the progress bar each time it updates :/
** TODO Opening a second file resets the darkMode setting of existing windows(!)
** DONE Files can be edited without activating the license
