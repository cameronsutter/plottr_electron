** DONE Third window not opening!?
   I opened a file and then another with the dashboards open and it
   didn't open the third??

   False alarm!  It actually tries to focus a file when it's already
   open and that's what went wrong.
** DONE It seems that adding a new file to the list of known files doesn't work
   Needs binary installation...

   Remove a file from the list of known files and then open it in a
   window.  It should appear on the dashboards of all windows, but it
   doesn't.
** DONE It seems that changing language from the menu does nothing?
   It still seems to work from the dashboard options...
** DONE Open dashboard from menu doesn't seem to work anymore
** DONE Ad view countdown re-renders the progress bar each time it updates :/
** DONE Opening a second file resets the darkMode setting of existing windows(!)

** DONE Create error report errors out with sendToDashboard is not defined
   In: ~menus/help.js~
** DONE If we're in the file that we open from the dashboard then it doesn't switch

** TODO Update notification styles are broken
** TODO Overflow style of dashboard is broken
   Add many files.  You can't open the bottom ones.
